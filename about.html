        <h2>The Eaton Fire Experience</h2>
        <p>
          This interactive web experience was created to document and
          memorialize the significant impact of the Eaton Fire on Altadena and
          the surrounding Los Angeles communities. By combining data
          visualization, immersive storytelling, and personal accounts, we aim
          to educate the public about wildfire dynamics while honoring those
          affected by this devastating event.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our goal is to transform complex data into an emotionally resonant
          experience that helps visitors understand not only what happened
          during the fire, but also the human stories behind the statistics. We
          hope this project serves as both a memorial and an educational
          resource that contributes to community resilience and wildfire
          awareness.

        <p>
          This project was conceptualized and developed during the MIT Reality
          Hack hackathon, specifically at the Los Angeles satellite location.
          The hackathon brought together developers, designers, and storytellers
          to create mixed reality experiences that address real-world
          challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our team chose to focus on the Los Angeles wildfires, recognizing the
          profound impact these events have on local communities and the need
          for innovative approaches to disaster documentation, education, and
          memorialization. The project evolved from concept to prototype during
          an intensive development sprint, with continued refinement afterward
          to create the experience you see today.

          multiple authoritative sources, including official reports from the
          Los Angeles Fire Department, CAL FIRE, and the National Weather
          Service. Satellite imagery and progression data were obtained from
